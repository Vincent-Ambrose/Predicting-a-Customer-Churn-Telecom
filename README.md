Description of the project:

This project aims to predict if a customer will leave the telecom service provider. We have the data of the past behavior of 
customers and the termination of contracts with the company.

The project is done in VS code with Jupyter Notebook extension.

In this repository you can find the .csv files to perform this analysis.
